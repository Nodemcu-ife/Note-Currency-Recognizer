# Note-Currency-Recognizer
Note currency recognizer device helps visually impaired people to know the value of money they have in their hand via automated voice.
Note currency recognizer serves only local Malaysian bills which are RM 1, RM 5, RM 10, RM 20, RM 50 and RM 100. The RGB color sensor is coded to recognize a region of the bill while Arduino micro-controller process the information from the color sensor. 
The speaker module is activated and the voice is played based on the stored voices of each bill inside the MP3 module(DF Miniplayer). 
A Lippo rechargeable battery of 7.4v and 1300mAh is used to powered the note currency recognizer.
RGB COLOUR SENSOR
complete color detector including RGB sensor chip and it can detect and measure a nearly limitless range of visible colors
ARDUINO UNO
Arduino is a microcontroller-based kits of computer hardware for building digital devices and interactive objects that can sense and control objects and the physical world. It read pulses from a scanner that detect the currency; the sketch of an image will be uploaded to the Arduino using the scanner then some coding will be inserted by special software to identified or make a differences in the value of each notes
SPEAKER
Speaker is a device that give an output from our system.It gives a sound of each value of the note that we inserted under the colour sensor.It connected with the system and get the code from the Arduino to be functioned
MP3 MODULE(DF MINI PLAYER)
it is a small and low price MP3 module with an simplified output directly to the speaker.It also can be used as a stand alone module with attached battery, speaker and push buttons or used in combination with an Arduino UNO or any other with RX/TX capabilities.The audio data sorted by folder and can supports up to 100 folders, every folder can hold up to 255 songs
